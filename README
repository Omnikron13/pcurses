PCURSES
-------

A curses frontend to libalpm, currently in development.

QUICK TUTORIAL
--------------

Keybindings are displayed by pressing the 'h' (Help) key in pcurses.

Filtering takes the following syntax:

nd:game
1 23

1
is a list of field specifiers. These tell pcurses which fields to search. Field
specifiers are the highlighted characters in the field names in the info pane.
In this example, this means that the Name and Description are searched for the
phrase 'game'.

2 
the character ':' separates the field specifier list from the search phrase. If
this character is not present, the entire string is interpreted as the search
phrase.

3
is the actual search phrase. If it contains only alphanumeric characters, a
simple and quick string search is used. Otherwise, it is treated as a regular
expression (which is a bit slower). The search is case INSENSITIVE.

1 and 2 are OPTIONAL.

These searches can be chained. This means that a search for 'n:^a', followed by
'b:2010' will show all packages beginning with the letter 'a' and having a build
date in the year 2010.

Previous filters are cleared by pressing the 'c' key.

Pressing the up and down keys while in input mode will scroll through all previous history.


Colorcoding and sorting use the same syntax as filtering, but only accept a single field specifier.


Command execution can be entered by pressing the '!' key. The token '%p' will be replaced by the selected package list. For example, with a current package selection of pcurses and pacman,

!echo '%p' | less

will be expanded to 

echo 'pcurses pacman' | less

Useful commands could be 

!pacman -Si %p
!sudo pacman -S %p

and so forth.
